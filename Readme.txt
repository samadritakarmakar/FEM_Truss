Then enter number of elements.
Each truss may be considered as an element. Any point of application of force are to be broken up into two different elements. A node resides between two elements. 
Then enter the number of nodes. The node entry should be preferably in ascending order starting from 1.
Then enter node numbers on both side of each element. 1st node is node number on one side of the element and 2nd node is on the other side of the element.
